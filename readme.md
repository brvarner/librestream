# Â¡Bienvenidos a LibreStream Amigo!

Welcome to LibreStream! I built this single page vanilla js streaming site during a Cuban vacation.

The WiFi at my hostel, and the Cubacel data coverage weren't very fast, so I wanted something that would let me stream random things with a lower resolution instead of always waiting for things to buffer.

This site grabs videos from two sources: The Library of Congress and The Internet Archive.

## How does it work?
